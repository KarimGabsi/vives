## Pseudocode

Exercise

### Criteria

b = depth of the tree <br />
d = (average) branching factor of the tree <br />
m = depth of the shallowest solution <br />

### Speed

$$
Time\ Complexity = WIDTH * b * m => if goal at depth m
\\\ \\\
Time\ Complexity = WIDTH * b * d => if no solution found
$$

### Memory

QUEUE always has length WIDTH. <br />
Memory usage is constant. <br />
Memory = WIDTH <br />
