# Depth First Search

![image](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs_bfs.webp "dfs vs bfs")

## Pseudocode

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- Create new paths (to all children)
- Reject the new paths with loops
- Add the new path to the **<u>front</u>** of QUEUE

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE

### Criteria

b = depth of the tree <br />
d = (average) branching factor of the tree <br />
m = depth of the shallowest solution <br />

### Speed

$$
Time\ Complexity = 1 + ... + b^{d-1} + b^d = \frac{b^{d-1}-1}{b-1}
\\\ \\\
Time\ Complexity: O(b^d)
$$

### Memory

$$
State\ Complexity = ((b-1)*d) + 1
\\\ \\\
State\ Complexity: O(d*b)
$$


## CODE

### State Space Declaration

1. Create a Maze
```python
maze = Maze.create(['o....',
                    '.###.',
                    '.#*#.',
                    '.#...',
                    '.....'])
maze.plot()
```

2. Transform the Maze Object into a **MazeState** object and get the initial path.

```python
initial_state = MazeState(maze, maze.get_start_position())
initial_path = Path(initial_state)
```

### Exercise

3. Implement a Depth/Breadth First Search Algorithm

Don't forget to pass the initial path.

```python
def exercise_function(initial_path):
    pass

path_to_goal = exercise_function(initial_path)
```

4. Plot the solution

```python
maze.plot(solution_path=path_to_goal.get_current_solution())
```
