# Breadth First Search

![image](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs_bfs.webp "dfs vs bfs")

## Pseudocode

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- Create new paths (to all children)
- Reject the new paths with loops
- Add the new path to the **<u>back</u>** of QUEUE

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE

### Criteria

b = depth of the tree <br />
d = (average) branching factor of the tree <br />
m = depth of the shallowest solution <br />

### Speed & Memory

$$
Time\ Complexity: O(b^m)
