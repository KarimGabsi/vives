# Iterative Deepening Search

## Pseudocode

1) DEPTH = 1

2) WHILE (goal is not reached)
- perform Depth-limited search
- DEPTH = DEPTH + 1


## Pseudocode: depth-limited

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- IF (PATH has length smaller than DEPTH)
  - Create new paths (to all children)
  - Reject new paths with loops
  - Add new path to the **<u>front</u>** of QUEUE

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE

### Criteria

b = depth of the tree <br />
d = (average) branching factor of the tree <br />
m = depth of the shallowest solution <br />

### Speed

$$
Time\ Complexity = 1 + ... + b^{m-2} + b^{m-1} = \frac{b^m-1}{b-1}
\\\ \\\
Time\ Complexity: O(b^m)
$$

### Memory

$$
Time\ Complexity: O(b*m)
$$
