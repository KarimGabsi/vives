## Documentation

The student investigates the **mini-max** algorithm and writes **an essay** about it.

This paper has:
- information about the algorithm
- pseudocode of the algorithm
- properties of the algorithm such as complete/space/speed/memory/etc.
- information about the implementation of the algorithm in your application. (important objects/methods)

## Application

The student programs a [tic-tac-toe](/docs-intro-to-ai/Erasmus/Game) game that implements the mini-max algorithm.

This application has **THREE** versions:

**[VERSION 1]: ** A fully functional **console** tic-tac-toe written in **python**: <br />
No Artificial Intelligence -> But two player functionality with `WIN/LOSS` verification.

**[VERSION 2]: ** The console application with the **mini-max** algorithm implementation.

**[VERSION 3]: ** (version 1 + version 2 + GUI)
- Two player functionality
- A.I. functionality (mini-max)
- G.U.I. (Graphical User Interface) -> TKinter
