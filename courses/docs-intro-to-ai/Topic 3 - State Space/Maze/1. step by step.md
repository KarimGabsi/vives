# Step by step guide

## Intro
The maze problem is a commonly used problem to test search algorithms on. In this exercise we imagine a maze as a rooster with rows and n columns. So we have a total of n x n squares. A section can contain a barrier, i.e. one cannot be 'walked'.

The challenge is, given a starting position (bottom left of the example), to find a path to the target (top right of the example). The possible directions in which to walk are: left, right, up and down. It is not possible to walk diagonally. Here are our **production rules** here, which we are going to use on our current state of **state** to know important things we can take in a next step. In order to determine those next moves or **moves**, we need to know the following in addition to the production rules:

- the *position* what it is where we stand;
- the *configuration* of the maze;
- the *path* we have already traveled.

The first point is clear, the second is necessary because we need to know where the barriers and edges are, and the last point is necessary because we don't want to start on our steps. When we have calculated all possible movements, then we can take one out and thus arrive at one further state. The choice of that move depends on the search algorithm that we are going to apply. We will go into this in more detail in the following topics. In this notebook we make an implementation of the **state-space** and the production rules for the maze problem. The state space is the set of all possible states of the search problem.

## Position

In the maze we must therefore first and foremost be able to indicate the different boxes or positions. 
For this we define a class `Position` that represents a (irow, icol) coordinate in the maze.
The top left coordinate is (0, 0).

```python
class Position:
  
    def __init__(self, irow, icol):
        self.irow = irow
        self.icol = icol

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.irow == other.irow and self.icol == other.icol
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return "({}, {})".format(self.irow, self.icol)
```

Method `__init__` can be seen as the constructor of the class (even though in principle it is not a real constructor). We also want to check whether two positions are equal or not, so we override the "equality" method `__eq__`, which overrides the equality operator `==`. This method returns "True" if the coordinates of two positions are equal, and "False" if they are not. Method `__repr__` is the method that returns an object of that class as a string. We also override that method so that the coordinate is displayed.

Now suppose we want to store the position on the cell in row 1 and column 2, then we instantiate a `Position` object with coordinates `irow=1` and `icol=2`. We assign the object to variable `p1`:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
p1 = Position(irow=1, icol=2) 
p1
```

</p>
</details>

We define a second position with coordinate (2, 2). We instantiate a new `Position` object and assign it to variable p2:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
p2 = Position(2, 2)
p2
```

</p>
</details>

We now check if the two positions are equal, which they are not, so we should get `False`:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
p1 == p2
```

</p>
</details>


If we check whether they are not equal, we get `True`:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
p1 != p2
```

</p>
</details>

## Path

We also need to be able to keep track of the path already traveled, so we define a class `Path`. 
That path consists of a sequence of consecutive positions, which we pass with the constructor, which in turn assigns the sequence to attribute `positions`. We also define a property `length` which gives the path length, and properties `irow` and `icol` which give the coordinates as a NumPy array. A NumPy array is just like a list, but intended for numerical elements, on which you can perform all kinds of matrix operations. We also provide a method `contains` which checks whether or not a given position belongs to the path, and an method `add` which adds a new position to the path and returns a new `Path` object with the new path. Finally, we again override the `__repr__` method to display the path nicely as a string.

```python
import numpy as np

class Path:

    def __init__(self, *positions):
        self.positions = positions
    
    @property
    def length(self):
        return len(self.positions)
    
    @property
    def irow(self):
        return np.array([position.irow for position in self.positions])

    @property
    def icol(self):
        return np.array([position.icol for position in self.positions])

    def contains(self, position):
        return position in self.positions
    
    def add(self, position):
        return Path(*self.positions, position)

    def __repr__(self):
        positions = ", ".join([str(position) for position in self.positions])
        return f"[{positions}]"
```

We define a path with positions (2, 2) and (3, 2). We instantiate a `Path` object that takes the two `Position` objects as separate input arguments. We put the `Path` object in variable `path`:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
path = Path(Position(2, 2), Position(3, 2))
path
```

</p>
</details>

We request the length of the path:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
path.length
```

</p>
</details>

And we check the coordinates:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
path.irow, path.icol
```

</p>
</details>

Do our positions p1 and p2 belong to path?

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
print(path.contains(p1))
print(path.contains(p2))
```

</p>
</details>

Finally, we create a new path by adding position (4, 2) to path:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_path = path.add(Position(4, 2))
new_path
```

</p>
</details>

## Maze

Next, we also need to implement the maze configuration. We define a class `Maze` that represents a maze as a square grid with n x n squares. The number of boxes `n` is stored in the attribute `size`. The grid is defined by means of a 2D NumPy array, which is stored in attribute `grid`, and contains integers as elements with the following code:

- 0: start box
- 1: free space
- 2: box with barrier
- 3: end box

The `grid` array is passed to the constructor. To make our lives a little easier, we define a static method `create` that contains a `maze` list of strings with the following symbols:

- `'*'`: start box
- `'.'`: free space
- `'#'`: box with barrier
- `'o'`: end box

The method converts the list of strings to a `grid` array, instantiates a new `Maze` object, and returns it. By the way, the `__repr__` method we override again returns a string containing the maze configuration with the same symbols.

We also define methods `get_start` and `get_goal` that return the start and end positions as `Position` objects. The `is_valid` method checks whether a given position is valid or not. A position is not valid if it falls outside the grid or points to a square with a barrier. Finally, there is another `plot` method with which we can plot the maze. For this we use the MatPlotLib library.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors

class Maze:
   
    symbols = ('*', '.', '#', 'o')
    
    def __init__(self, grid):
        # grid is integer array:
        # start = 0, free = 1, wall = 2, goal = 3
        self.grid = np.array(grid)
        self.size = self.grid.shape[0]

    def get_start(self):
        irow, icol = np.where(self.grid == 0)
        return Position(irow[0], icol[0])

    def get_goal(self):
        irow, icol = np.where(self.grid == 3)
        return Position(irow[0], icol[0])
    
    def is_valid(self, position):
        # checkt of een positie geldig is: moet binnen het grid liggen en mag geen barrière zijn
        return (0 <= position.irow < self.size and
                0 <= position.icol < self.size and 
                self.grid[position.irow, position.icol] != 2)
    
    def plot(self):
        # colormap
        cmap = colors.ListedColormap(['forestgreen', 'lightyellow', 'purple', 'red'])
        bounds = np.linspace(-0.5, 3.5, 5)
        norm = colors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)
        # plot grid
        plt.matshow(self.grid, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)
        # axes
        xmax = self.size - 0.5
        ymax = self.size - 0.5
        ax = plt.gca()
        ax.set_aspect("equal")
        ax.set_xticks(np.linspace(-0.5, xmax, self.size + 1))
        ax.set_xticklabels([])
        ax.set_yticks(np.linspace(-0.5, ymax, self.size + 1))
        ax.set_yticklabels([])
        ax.tick_params(axis=u'both', which=u'both', length=0)
        # plot grid and set axis limits
        plt.grid()
        plt.xlim([-0.5, xmax])
        plt.ylim([ymax, -0.5])
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return "\n".join([''.join([self.symbols[item] for item in row]) for row in self.grid])

    @staticmethod
    def create(maze):
        # creëert grid adhv list van strings "maze"
        return Maze(grid=[[Maze.symbols.index(symbol) for symbol in row] for row in maze])
```

We now create the following maze using the static method `create`:

```
['O....',
  '.###.',
  '.#*#.',
  '.#...',
  '.....']
```
We assign the created `Maze` object to variable `maze`:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
maze = Maze.create(["o....",
                    ".###.",
                    ".#*#.",
                    ".#...",
                    "....."])
maze
```

</p>
</details>

We check the start and end position:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
print("start:", maze.get_start())
print("doel:", maze.get_goal())
```

</p>
</details>


And we plot the maze:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
maze.plot()
```

![mazeplot](/img/intro-to-ai/mazeplot.png)

</p>
</details>


Can we stand on the square (1, 2)?

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
maze.is_valid(Position(1, 2))
```

</p>
</details>




## State-space OOP Model

Before we go any further, we first implement an OO model in which the following concepts are incorporated:
* **state**: a class in which you can display the state of the search problem. You must be able to apply a move to a state to go to another state.
* **goal**: you have to be able to evaluate whether a certain state is in the goal state or not.
* **move**: a move determines how you can move from one state to another

This OO structure provides a generic framework in which we can formulate the search problems. After implementing this generic framework, a specific implementation for the maze problem is created.

We start with the abstract class `State`. For a certain state, we need to be able to calculate the possible moves, determine whether or not it concerns the final state, and apply a move. For each of those 3 actions we define an abstract method that will then have to be implemented for solving a specific problem through inheritance.

```py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class State(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_moves(self):
        # Op een state wordt deze methode aangeroepen om volgens de production rules
        # de moves te berekenen die het probleem in een nieuwe toestand kunnen brengen.
        # Deze functie geeft dus een lijst van moves terug (eventueel leeg).
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def apply_move(self, move):
        # Op een state kan een move toegepast worden om naar een volgende state over te gaan.
        # Deze functie geeft dus een nieuwe state terug.
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def is_goal(self):
        # Controleert of een state de `goal state` is.
        # Retourneert dus een booleaanse waarde.
        pass
```

And then we have the `Move` class, which contains a `State` object, and one will apply itself to that state.

```py 
class Move:
    
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state
    
    def apply(self):
        return self.state.apply_move(self)
```

## Maze state-space representation

We now create a class `MazeMove`, based on the class `Move`. In other words, we apply inheritance, where `MazeMove` is a subclass of `Move`.

Problem-specific information must of course also be provided in the constructor. Here we should be able to move to the next position with that information. We do this by defining `drow` and `dcol`. The formulas are:

> `irow_new = irow + drow`

> `icol_new = icon + dcol`

With method `new_position` that new position is calculated in that way and returned as new `Position` object. Note that only the new position is calculated, but the move is not yet applied. in other words the state is not changed yet, because that is the job of the inherited method `apply`.

Also note that here we are not reasoning from the generic `State` class, but from the specific maze problem we are going to solve.

We also override method `__repr__` to return a string representation of the move. The production rules dictate that we can only go left, right, up or down. The strings are therefore `'left`, `'right`, `'up'`, `'down'`.

```py 
class MazeMove(Move):

    def __init__(self, state, drow=0, dcol=0):
        super().__init__(state)
        self.drow = drow
        self.dcol = dcol
    
    def new_position(self):
        return Position(self.state.position.irow + self.drow, self.state.position.icol + self.dcol)

    def __repr__(self):
        if self.dcol == -1:
            return 'left'
        if self.dcol == 1:
            return 'right'
        if self.drow == -1:
            return 'up'
        if self.drow == 1:
            return 'down'
```

Since we shouldn't have to think about which values for drow and dcol to pass, we define classes Left, Right, Up and Down, which of course inherit from superclass MazeMove:

```py 
class Left(MazeMove):    
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, dcol=-1)

class Right(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, dcol=1)

class Up(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, drow=-1)

class Down(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, drow=1)
```

Finally, we still need to implement the state using class `MazeState` which of course inherits from abstract superclass `State`. Remember that a state is characterized by a maze configuration, a current position and a path already traveled. Hence, the constructor accepts a `Maze` object, a `Position` object, and a `Path` object, which are stored in attributes `maze`, `position` and `path`. Note that the current position is not part of our already traveled path, so we define a property `full_path` that contains the current position.

Of course we then have to implement the abstract methods: `calculate_moves` gives us all valid moves. That is why we also define a method `is_valid` that checks whether a new position is valid within the maze and does not belong to the already traveled path, because we do not want to retrace our steps. With method `apply_move` we can then apply one of those moves, which brings us into a new state. That method also returns a new `MazeState` object that captures this new state. Finally, `is_goal` checks whether the state is the final state.

With the `plot` method, the maze is printed out and the path traveled and current position are added to the plot. The `dynamic_plot` dynamically visualizes the path traveled, where input argument `wait` determines how many seconds - half a second by default - to wait before showing the next plot. Finally, the `__repr__` is also overwritten to display the maze along with the path.

```py
from IPython.display import clear_output
from time import sleep


class MazeState(State):

    def __init__(self, maze, position, path):
        self.maze = maze
        self.position = position
        self.path = path
    
    @property
    def full_path(self):
        return self.path.add(self.position)

    def calculate_moves(self):
        if self.is_goal():
            return []  # geen moves meer als we in de eindtoestand zijn
        moves = [Left(self), Right(self), Up(self), Down(self)]
        return [move for move in moves if self.is_valid(move)]

    def is_valid(self, move):
        new_position = move.new_position()
        return self.maze.is_valid(new_position) and not self.path.contains(new_position)

    def apply_move(self, move):
        return MazeState(self.maze, move.new_position(), self.full_path)  # nieuwe toestand

    def is_goal(self):
        return self.maze.get_goal() == self.position

    def plot(self):
        self.maze.plot()
        x = np.arange(0, self.maze.grid.size)
        plt.plot(x[self.position.icol], x[self.position.irow], 'bo')
        if self.path.length > 0:
            plt.plot(x[self.path.icol], x[self.path.irow], 'ko', )

    def dynamic_plot(self, wait=0.5):
        x = np.arange(0, self.maze.grid.size)
        icol, irow = [], []
        for position in self.path.positions:
            self.maze.plot()
            irow.append(position.irow)
            icol.append(position.icol)
            plt.plot(x[icol], x[irow], 'ko')
            plt.show()
            sleep(wait)
            clear_output()
        self.plot()

    def __repr__(self):
        full_path = self.full_path
        if full_path.length > 1:
            symbols = Maze.symbols + ('x', '!')
            grid = self.maze.grid.copy()
            full_path = self.full_path
            irow, icol = full_path.irow[1:], full_path.icol[1:]
            if grid[irow[-1], icol[-1]] == 3:
                grid[irow[:-1], icol[:-1]] = 4
                grid[irow[-1], icol[-1]] = 5
            else:
                grid[irow, icol] = 4
            return "\n".join([''.join([symbols[item] for item in row]) for row in grid])
        else:
            return str(self.maze)
```

To make our lives easier, we define a class `InitialMazeState` with the initial state of the maze problem. in other words this class instantiates an object with a given maze configuration where the position is the start position and the path traveled is empty.

```py
class InitialMazeState(MazeState):
    def __init__(self, maze):
        super().__init__(maze, maze.get_start(), Path())
```

With this class we are now going to define the initial state of the `maze` we defined above:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
ini_state = InitialMazeState(maze)
ini_state
```

</p>
</details>


We plot this initial state:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
ini_state.plot()
```

![mazeplot2](/img/intro-to-ai/mazeplot2.png)

</p>
</details>

We calculate the moves that are possible from this initial state:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
moves = ini_state.calculate_moves()
moves
```

</p>
</details>

We can really only go down. Let's do that:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state = ini_state.apply_move(moves[0])
new_state
```

</p>
</details>

And let's plot that new state:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state.plot()
```

![mazeplot3](/img/intro-to-ai/mazeplot3.png)

</p>
</details>


What are the possible moves here?

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
moves = new_state.calculate_moves()
moves
```

</p>
</details>


Let's go right:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state = new_state.apply_move(moves[0])
new_state
```

</p>
</details>


And we make a plot again:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state.plot()
```

![mazeplot4](/img/intro-to-ai/mazeplot4.png)

</p>
</details>

We can proceed to the target by using a `while` loop to calculate the possible moves in each new state and then take the first move each time:

<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
while not new_state.is_goal():
    print(new_state)
    moves = new_state.calculate_moves()
    print(moves)
    print()
    new_state = new_state.apply_move(moves[0])
```

</p>
</details>

So we have entered the final state and can plot it to see the path traveled from start to target:


<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state.plot()
```

![mazeplot5](/img/intro-to-ai/mazeplot5.png)

</p>
</details>

We can also visualize the travel of the path "live":


<details>
<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```python
new_state.dynamic_plot()
```

## Excercises

## Excercise 1

Start again from the initial state, but now *always* take the *first* move from the list of possible moves. Do you get the same path?

## Excercise 2

Start again from the initial state, but now *always* take the *last* move from the list of possible moves. Do you get a solution?

## Excercise 3

Now try to follow the path to the goal that runs to the left of the barriers.

Tip: You can put the `MazeMove` classes in a list, eg `[Left, Right, Up, Down]`, and loop through them with a `for` loop.


## Excercise 4

Implement the maze from the figure at the beginning of this notebook and follow the shortest path from start to goal. Are there multiple options?


## Excercise 5

Create your own maze with a start and end space and various barriers. Implement different paths from start to goal. Can you think of an algorithm to always find a path from start to target without getting stuck?


## Extra

Take the game [Goose board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose). Suppose we want to move through the board with one pawn from start to finish. Think about the state-space representation:

- What are the production rules?
- How do you define the state?
- How would you implement that in Python?
