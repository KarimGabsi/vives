# Heuristic Estimate Extention

## Pseudocode

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- Create new paths (to all children)
- Reject the new paths with loops
- Add the new paths to the QUEUE and sort the entire QUEUE **by**  $\bold{F(x)= cost + h}$

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE
