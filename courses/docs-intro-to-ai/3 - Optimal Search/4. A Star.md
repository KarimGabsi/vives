# A* algorithm

Is a UNIFORM COST algorithm with:
- Branch and bound extention
- Estimate extention
- Redundant path deletion extention

## Pseudocode

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- Create new paths (to all children)
- Reject the new paths with loops
- Add the new paths to the QUEUE and sort the entire QUEUE **by**  $\bold{F(x)= cost + h}$
- IF QUEUE contains:
  - path P terminating I, with COST_P
  - path q containing I, with COST_Q
  AND IF COST_P >= COST_Q THEN:
  DELETE path P

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE
