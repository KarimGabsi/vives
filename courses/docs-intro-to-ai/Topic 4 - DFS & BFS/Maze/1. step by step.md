# Step by step guide

## Intro
The maze problem is a commonly used problem to test search algorithms on. A maze is a grid with n x n squares. A box can contain a barrier, these are boxes on which it is not possible to 'walk'. The challenge is, given a starting position (bottom left of the example), to find a path to the target (top right of the example). Possible directions in which to walk (in that order!) are: left, right, up and down. It is not possible to walk diagonally.

In this notebook, we implement the depth-first and width-first algorithm, in English Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS). We use the state-space and the production rules for the maze problem that we elaborated in the previous topic.
![Maze](/img/intro-to-ai/maze.png)


## State-Space Representation

Before we go any further, we first implement an OO model in which the following concepts are incorporated:
* **state**: a class in which you can display the state of the search problem. You must be able to apply a move to a state to go to another state.
* **goal**: you have to be able to evaluate whether a certain state is in the goal state or not.
* **move**: a move determines how you can move from one state to another

This OO structure provides a generic framework in which we can formulate the search problems. After implementing this generic framework, a specific implementation for the maze problem is created.

We start with the abstract class `State`. For a certain state, we need to be able to calculate the possible moves, determine whether or not it concerns the final state, and apply a move. For each of those 3 actions we define an abstract method that will then have to be implemented for solving a specific problem through inheritance.

```py title="imports"
# first we import the necessary Python packages, modules, classes and functions
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from IPython.display import clear_output
from time import sleep
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import colors
```

```py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class State(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_moves(self):
        # On a state this method is called according to the production rules
        # calculate the moves that can bring the problem into a new state.
        # This function returns a list of moves (empty if necessary).
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def apply_move(self, move):
        # A move can be applied to a state to move to the next state.
        # This function returns a new state.
        pass
        
    @abstractmethod
    def is_goal(self):
        # Checks whether a state is the `goal state`.
        # So returns a boolean value.
        pass
```

And then we have the `Move` class, which contains a `State` object, and one will apply itself to that state.

```py 
class Move:
    
    def __init__(self, state):
        self.state = state
    
    def apply(self):
        return self.state.apply_move(self)
```

Then we applied inheritance to implement our specific maze problem.

We have defined the **state** on the basis of:

- the position which is the box where we stand;
- the configuration of the maze;
- the path we have already traveled.

The classes below implement these concepts.


```py 
class Position:
  
    def __init__(self, irow, icol):
        self.irow = irow
        self.icol = icol

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.irow == other.irow and self.icol == other.icol
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return "({}, {})".format(self.irow, self.icol)
```

```py 
class Path:

    def __init__(self, *positions):
        self.positions = positions
    
    @property
    def length(self):
        return len(self.positions)
    
    @property
    def irow(self):
        return np.array([position.irow for position in self.positions])

    @property
    def icol(self):
        return np.array([position.icol for position in self.positions])

    def contains(self, position):
        return position in self.positions
    
    def add(self, position):
        return Path(*self.positions, position)

    def __repr__(self):
        positions = ", ".join([str(position) for position in self.positions])
        return f"[{positions}]"
```

```py 
class Maze:
   
    symbols = ('*', '.', '#', 'o')
    
    def __init__(self, grid):
        # grid must be an integer array:
        # start = 0, free = 1, wall = 2, goal = 3
        self.grid = np.array(grid)
        self.size = self.grid.shape[0]

    def get_start(self):
        irow, icol = np.where(self.grid == 0)
        return Position(irow[0], icol[0])

    def get_goal(self):
        irow, icol = np.where(self.grid == 3)
        return Position(irow[0], icol[0])
    
    def is_valid(self, position):
        # checks if the position is valid: it has to be within the grid and cannot have a barrier.
        return (0 <= position.irow < self.size and
                0 <= position.icol < self.size and 
                self.grid[position.irow, position.icol] != 2)
    
    def plot(self):
        # colormap
        cmap = colors.ListedColormap(['forestgreen', 'lightyellow', 'purple', 'red'])
        bounds = np.linspace(-0.5, 3.5, 5)
        norm = colors.BoundaryNorm(bounds, cmap.N)
        # plot grid
        plt.matshow(self.grid, cmap=cmap, norm=norm)
        # axes
        xmax = self.size - 0.5
        ymax = self.size - 0.5
        ax = plt.gca()
        ax.set_aspect("equal")
        ax.set_xticks(np.linspace(-0.5, xmax, self.size + 1))
        ax.set_xticklabels([])
        ax.set_yticks(np.linspace(-0.5, ymax, self.size + 1))
        ax.set_yticklabels([])
        ax.tick_params(axis=u'both', which=u'both', length=0)
        # plot grid and set axis limits
        plt.grid()
        plt.xlim([-0.5, xmax])
        plt.ylim([ymax, -0.5])
        
    def __repr__(self):
        return "\n".join([''.join([self.symbols[item] for item in row]) for row in self.grid])

    @staticmethod
    def create(maze):
        # creates a grid on the basis of a list of strings "maze"
        return Maze(grid=[[Maze.symbols.index(symbol) for symbol in row] for row in maze])
```

Now we can define the `MazeMove` and `MazeState` subclasses. 
To make our lives a little easier, the `MazeMove` have also created subclasses `Left`, `Right`, `Up` and `Down`, and `InitialMazeState` for the initial state of our maze problem,
which of course inherits from class ` MazeState`. 

Note that in that last class we put our production rules "left, right, up, down" in attribute `rules` and we added a method `set_production_rules` that allows us to modify those `rules`.

```py 
class MazeMove(Move):

    def __init__(self, state, drow=0, dcol=0):
        super().__init__(state)
        self.drow = drow
        self.dcol = dcol
    
    def new_position(self):
        return Position(self.state.position.irow + self.drow, self.state.position.icol + self.dcol)

    def __repr__(self):
        if self.dcol == -1:
            return 'left'
        if self.dcol == 1:
            return 'right'
        if self.drow == -1:
            return 'up'
        if self.drow == 1:
            return 'down'
```

```py 
class Left(MazeMove):    
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, dcol=-1)

class Right(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, dcol=1)

class Up(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, drow=-1)

class Down(MazeMove):
    def __init__(self, state):
        super().__init__(state, drow=1)
```

```py 
class MazeState(State):

    def __init__(self, maze, position, path):
        self.maze = maze
        self.position = position
        self.path = path
        self.rules = [Left(self), Right(self), Up(self), Down(self)]
    
    @property
    def full_path(self):
        return self.path.add(self.position)

    def set_production_rules(self, *moves):
        # moves is input lijst met Move klassen
        self.rules = [move(self) for move in moves]
    
    def calculate_moves(self):
        if self.is_goal():
            return []  # geen moves meer als we in de eindtoestand zijn
        return [move for move in self.rules if self.is_valid(move)]

    def is_valid(self, move):
        new_position = move.new_position()
        return self.maze.is_valid(new_position) and not self.path.contains(new_position)

    def apply_move(self, move):
        new_state = MazeState(self.maze, move.new_position(), self.full_path)  # nieuwe toestand
        Moves = [type(rule) for rule in self.rules]

            plt.plot(x[self.path.icol], x[self.path.irow], 'ko', )

    def dynamic_plot(self, wait=0.5):
        x = np.arange(0, self.maze.grid.size)
        icol, irow = [], []
        for position in self.path.positions:
            self.maze.plot()

            icol.append(position.icol)
            plt.plot(x[icol], x[irow], 'ko')
            plt.show()
            sleep(wait)
            clear_output()
        self.plot()

    def __repr__(self):
        full_path = self.full_path
        if full_path.length > 1:
            symbols = Maze.symbols + ('x', '!')
            grid = self.maze.grid.copy()
            full_path = self.full_path
            irow, icol = full_path.irow[1:], full_path.icol[1:]
            if grid[irow[-1], icol[-1]] == 3:
                grid[irow[:-1], icol[:-1]] = 4
                grid[irow[-1], icol[-1]] = 5
            else:
                grid[irow, icol] = 4
            return "\n".join([''.join([symbols[item] for item in row]) for row in grid])
        else:
            return str(self.maze)
```

```py 
class InitialMazeState(MazeState):
    def __init__(self, maze):
        super().__init__(maze, maze.get_start(), Path())
```

We are now ready to solve the maze problem by using search algorithms. We start with the well-known blind search algorithms depth-first and width-first.

But first, let's implement our maze example from the previous notebook so that we have a test case.

### Example
We create the following maze using the static method `Maze.create`:

```python
['O....',
  '.###.',
  '.#*#.',
  '.#...',
  '.....']
```
We assign the returned `Maze` object to variable `maze`. We make a plot to see if the maze is defined correctly.

<summary>Show solution</summary>
<p>

```py
maze = Maze.create(['o....',
                    '.###.',
                    '.#*#.',
                    '.#...',
                    '.....'])

maze.plot()
```

</details>

## DFS and BFS

With a search algorithm we want to look for a path in the search tree through which you can reach the goal. Usually you will not calculate the full search tree explicitly. We indeed do not do this for depth-first and width-first.

We must be able to imagine a path from starting position to goal. After all, a node in the search tree corresponds to a path. But because our state already contains the path, each node in the search tree also corresponds to a state. Therefore, in the pseudocode of DFS and BFS, we can simply replace 'path' with 'state', and so the 'root' of our search tree corresponds to the 'initial state'.

We translate the pseudocode of both algorithms into Python code and apply it to our `maze` problem.

### Depth-first

The pseudocode of DFS from the course:

![Pseudocode](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/pseudocode.png)

We can now easily translate that pseudocode to Python code, if we replace 'path' with the corresponding `MazeState` objects, as we explained above:
```py
# 1. queue <- path only containing the root
queue = [InitialMazeState(maze)]

# 2. while (queue is not empty and goal is not reached)
goal_is_reached = False
while queue and not goal_is_reached:
    
    # remove the first path from the queue
    first_state = queue.pop(0)

    # create new paths (to all children)
    # reject the new paths with loops (which is also done by method calculate_moves)
    new_states = [first_state.apply_move(move) for move in first_state.calculate_moves()]
    
    # update goal_is_reached
    for state in new_states:
        if state.is_goal():
            goal_is_reached = True
            break

    # add the new paths to the FRONT of the queue
    queue = new_states + queue

# 3. if (goal reached) then success else failure
print("SUCCESS" if goal_is_reached else "FAILURE")
```
Output: SUCCESS

We see that DFS applies the LIFO principle: **last in first out!**

Since we are using a break in the loop that checks if one of the new_states is the final state, state will contain our solution (if there is a solution):

```py 
state.full_path
```

Output: [(2, 2), (3, 2), (3, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (1, 4), (0, 4), (0, 3), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 0)]

We can now also plot the path through 'live':
```py 
state.dynamic_plot()
```

![mazeplot](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/mazeplot2.png)

### Width-first

The pseudocode of BFS from the course:

![Pseudocode](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/pseudocode2.png)

The algorithm is the same as that of DFS, only we have to add new paths *at the back* of the queue instead of the front, because BFS applies the FIFO principle: **first in first out!**

```py
# 1. queue <- path only containing the root
queue = [InitialMazeState(maze)]

# 2. while (queue is not empty and goal is not reached)
goal_is_reached = False
while queue and not goal_is_reached:
    
    # remove the first path from the queue
    first_state = queue.pop(0)

    # create new paths (to all children)
    # reject the new paths with loops (which is also done by method calculate_moves)
    new_states = [first_state.apply_move(move) for move in first_state.calculate_moves()]
    
    # update goal_is_reached
    for state in new_states:
        if state.is_goal():
            goal_is_reached = True
            break 

    # add the new paths to the BACK of the queue
    queue = queue + new_states

# 3. if (goal reached) then success else failure
print("SUCCES" if goal_is_reached else "FAILURE")
```

So we were able to copy the code from DFS, and we only had to adjust the following line of code:

```py 
# add the new paths to the BACK of the queue
queue = queue + new_states
```

However, we get a totally different solution because unlike DFS, BFS finds the shortest path!

```py 
state.dynamic_plot()
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Run DFS and BFS again but now print the last position of the paths in the queue after each iteration. The last position of a path is the square where one stands in that state.

Which algorithm is the fastest? Which algorithm needs the least memory?

It is clear that in this case DFS needs less computation time to find a solution and also less memory. DFS doesn't find the shortest path...

### Exercise 2

Apply DFS and BFS to the maze from the figure at the beginning of the notebook.

What is the fastest algorithm now? Which one needs the least memory? And which one finds the shortest path?


<details>

```py
maze2 = Maze.create(['....#...o',
                     '.........',
                     '#........',
                     '.#...#...',
                     '..#......',
                     '.........',
                     '.........',
                     '......#..',
                     '*......#.'])
maze2.plot()
```
![exercise 2](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise2.png)

We are going to chronometer the calculation time with function time from the module of the same name:

```py
from time import time
start_time = time()
x = 1
for _ in range(1000000):
    x += 1
elapsed_time = time() - start_time
print(elapsed_time)
```
Printing the queue becomes difficult in this case. That is why we are going to keep track of the length of the queue in a list. The maximum length will give us an idea of the memory usage.

DFS:

```py
# start time
starttime = time()

# 1. queue <- path only containing the root
queue = [InitialMazeState(maze2)]

# initialize length queue
length_queue = [1]

# 2. while (queue is not empty and goal is not reached)
goal_is_reached = False
while queue and not goal_is_reached:
    
    # length queue
    length_queue.append(len(queue))
    
    # remove the first path from the queue
    first_state = queue.pop(0)

    # create new paths (to all children)
    # reject the new paths with loops (which is also done by method calculate_moves)
    new_states = [first_state.apply_move(move) for move in first_state.calculate_moves()]
    
    # update goal_is_reached
    for state in new_states:
        if state.is_goal():
            goal_is_reached = True
            break 

    # add the new paths to the FRONT of the queue
    queue = new_states + queue

# 3. if (goal reached) then success else failure
print("SUCCES" if goal_is_reached else "FAILURE")

# print elapsed time
print("Elapsed time:", time() - starttime, 'seconds')

# print maximum length of queue
print('Maximum length of queue:', max(length_queue))
```
SUCCES <br />
Elapsed time: 0.00592350959777832 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 48 <br />
```py
state.dynamic_plot(0.5)

BFS:

length_queue = [1]

# 2. while (queue is not empty and goal is not reached)
goal_is_reached = False
while queue and not goal_is_reached:

    # length queue
    length_queue.append(len(queue))
    
    # remove the first path from the queue

Again, DFS is (much) faster and uses (much) less memory, but it certainly won't find the shortest path, while BFS obviously does. We clearly need more "intelligent" algorithms...

### Exercise 3

All that copied is of course not according to the rules of the art of programming. 
Can you put the code for DFS and BFS in one function? Test your function on the 'maze' example.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```py
def dfs_bfs(state, method):
# state is State object defining the initial state
# method is 'dfs' or 'bfs'

    # start time
    starttime = time()

    # 1. queue <- path only containing the root
    queue = [state]

    # initialize length queue
    length_queue = [len(queue)]

    # 2. while (queue is not empty and goal is not reached)
    goal_is_reached = state.is_goal()
    while queue and not goal_is_reached:

        # length queue
        length_queue.append(len(queue))
        
        # remove the first path from the queue
        first_state = queue.pop(0)

        # create new paths (to all children)
        # reject the new paths with loops (which is also done by method calculate_moves)
        new_states = [first_state.apply_move(move) for move in first_state.calculate_moves()]
        
        # update goal_is_reached
        for state in new_states:
            if state.is_goal():
                goal_is_reached = True
                break 

        # if method is DFS: add the new paths to the FRONT of the queue
        if method.lower() == 'dfs':
            queue = new_states + queue
        # if method is BFS: add the new paths to the BACK of the queue
        elif method.lower() == 'bfs':
            queue = queue + new_states

    # 3. if (goal reached) then success else failure
    print("SUCCES" if goal_is_reached else "FAILURE")

    # print elapsed time
    print("Elapsted time:", time() - starttime, 'seconds')

    # print maximum length of queue
    print('Maximum length of queue:', max(length_queue))

    # return goal state if goal is reached and None otherwise
    return state if goal_is_reached else None
```

Note that we are specifying an initial state and not a Maze object, because we want a generic function that is independent of the maze problem!
```py
solution = dfs_bfs(InitialMazeState(maze), 'dfs')
if solution:
    solution.plot() 
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.0011391639709472656 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 4 <br />

![exercise 3](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise3.png)

```py
solution = dfs_bfs(InitialMazeState(maze), 'bfs')
if solution:
    solution.plot()
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.002651691436767578 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 9 <br />

### Exercise 4

Create the maze below and apply DFS and BFS to find a solution:

```py
['......O',
  '.#####.',
  '.......',
  '.#####.',
  '.......',
  '.#####.',
  '*......']
```

Compare speed and memory again, and check if the shortest path is found.

```py
maze3 = Maze.create(['......o',
                     '.#####.',
                     '.......',
                     '.#####.',
                     '.......',
                     '.#####.',
                     '*......'])
maze3.plot()
```
![exercise 4](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise4.png)


```py
dfs_bfs(InitialMazeState(maze3), 'dfs').plot()
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.002966642379760742 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 6 <br />

![exercise 4](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise4b.png)

```py
dfs_bfs(InitialMazeState(maze3), 'bfs').plot()
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.004706621170043945 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 9 <br />

### Exercise 5

Take the same maze as in assignment 4, and apply DFS and BFS again, but now change the order of the production rules to "down, up, right, left" instead of "left, right, up, down". Are you still getting the same solution? Does changing that order affect computation time and memory usage?

Tip: Class `MazeState` and subclass `InitialMazeState` contain a method `set_production_rules` that allows you to easily change the order. In this case:

```py
maze_state_object.set_production_rules(Down, Up, Right, Left)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```py
# define initial state and change the order of production rules
ini_state = InitialMazeState(maze3)
ini_state.set_production_rules(Down, Up, Right, Left)
```

```py 
# dfs
dfs_bfs(ini_state, 'dfs').plot()
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.0007543563842773438 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 4 <br />

![exercise 5](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise5.png)


```py 
# bfs
dfs_bfs(ini_state, 'bfs').plot()
```

SUCCES <br />
Elapsted time: 0.004057168960571289 seconds <br />
Maximum length of queue: 9 <br />

![exercise 5](/img/intro-to-ai/dfs-bfs/exercise5b.png)

Obviously, changing the order in which the production rules are applied leads to different solutions.

</p>
</details>

### Exercise 6

Now make up some maze problems yourself and apply DFS and BFS to them. Also play with the order of the production rules. Study the obtained solutions by analyzing the contents of the queue after each iteration. On the exam you should be able to give the solution of those algorithms yourself!

### Extra

Take again the game [Goose board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose) that we used in the previous notebook. have modeled state-space representation. Now also apply DFS and BFS here to find a solution, i.e. a sequence of throws to get from start to finish. To limit the computation time at BFS, we will use 33 instead of 63 cells.

In the real goose board game it is of course possible to land on an earlier square, but because we want to avoid infinite loops, we exclude that option. In method `GooseBoardState.is_valid` we therefore also have to check whether or not a new position belongs to the traveled path. If so, then the move is invalid.


### Extra extent
Now also try to solve the goose board problem with 63 squares. How long does it take to find a solution with DFS? And how long does it take BFS? Can you explain that?
