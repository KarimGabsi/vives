# Hill Climbing

## Pseudocode

1) QUEUE (path containing the root)

2) WHILE (QUEUE is not empty AND goal is not reached)

- Remove the first path from the QUEUE
- Create new paths (to all children)
- Reject the new paths with loops
- `SORT the new path using the heuristic f`
- Add the new path to the **<u>front</u>** of QUEUE

3) IF (goal reached)

- THEN SUCCESS
- ELSE FAILURE


### Criteria

b = depth of the tree <br />
d = (average) branching factor of the tree <br />
m = depth of the shallowest solution <br />

### Speed

$$
Time\ Complexity = 1 + ... + b^{d-1} + b^d = \frac{b^{d-1}-1}{b-1}
\\\ \\\
Time\ Complexity: O(b^d)
$$

### Memory

$$
Time\ Complexity = ((b-1)*d) + 1
\\\ \\\
Time\ Complexity: O(d*b)
$$
