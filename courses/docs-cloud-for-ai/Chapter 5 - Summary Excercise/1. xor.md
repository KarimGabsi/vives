# Summary Exercise: XOR

It is now time to combine all the skills acquired from the previous four chapters into one summary exercise. <br />
And whilst we have seen the whole **Docker** and **Epsagon** aspect in this course, you still haven't done any 'real' A.I. implementation from scratch.
**It is now time to do so!**

## What is XOR?

XOR is an operation based on the [XOR GATE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate), which just is a logic gate that receives two inputs and either outputs `1 or HIGH` or `0 or LOW`.
It is an **exclusive or** from a mathematical logic standpoint, meaning that if one of the input differs from each other, it would output `1/HIGH` and if both inputs are the same it will output `0/LOW`.

    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Input</th>
      <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="blue">
      <td>A</td>
      <td>B</td>
      <td>A XOR B</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="red">0</td>
      <td class="red">0</td>
      <td class="red">0</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="red">0</td>
      <td class="green">1</td>
      <td class="green">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="green">1</td>
      <td class="red">0</td>
      <td class="green">1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="green">1</td>
      <td class="green">1</td>
      <td class="red">0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Python XOR

It's actually very simple to perform an XOR operation in Python:

```py 
def xor(a, b):
    return a ^ b
```

## Project XOR overview

### Requisites

- Build an [ANN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) that receives **two** inputs and has **one** output.
  - Document the following:
    - The process of building an `ANN`.
    - How many layers did you use?
    - [Underfitting vs overfitting](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit): How did you solve this?
    - **Auto Training**: After how many iterations of training did you achieve an accuracy of approximately **>99.00%** ?
  - Remember, you can easily generate training data with the function mentioned in [Python XOR](./xor#python-xor)
  - Don't forget to save your **model** for you will be using it in *two* containers, so it needs to be up-to-date!
- Deploy two containers with separate APIs sharing the same volume.
  - C1: Is where the user can insert two bits and try and predict the output.
  - C2: Is a simple website with three buttons:
    - Train 1 (trains one iteration of data)
    - Train 100 (trains a hundred iterations of data)
    - Auto Training (ON/OFF): continuously trains data (with timer). Make sure you can enable/disable this.

:::note
Model saving: [Pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) <br />

So you need to `save the model in C2` and `load the model in C1`.
:::

- Create a *new* dashboard in `Epsagon` that shows the following:
  - Visits & predictions from C1:
  - Visits & data trained from C2:
  - Accuracy measurements
  - Errors!
  - Alert via [slack](https://slack.com/) when reaching **80%, 90%, 95%, >99.00%** accuracy
  - *(Optional) Performance measuring*

- Make sure C1 & C2 has a **nice layout**, also include the [VIVES Logo](../../)
- Use [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) to autobuild your images
- When ready, compress *(zip)* the entire project with your documentation *(pdf)* and upload it to **Toledo**
