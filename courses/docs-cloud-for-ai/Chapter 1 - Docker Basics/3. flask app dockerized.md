# Flask App Dockerized

## Requirements.txt

Now that we have a simple Flask App up and running on our local machine it is time to dockerize it. <br />
But before need to be able to tell our soon to be **image** about our extra package we've just used. <br />
We can do this by generating a **requirements.txt** file for our python project. <br />

Open the **Terminal**: 
```bash title="Go to our project directory"
cd DockerProject
```

```bash title="Generate requirements.txt"
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The file should look somewhat like this (make sure you see **Flask==x.x.x**):

```bash
click==8.1.3
colorama==0.4.5
Flask==2.2.2
itsdangerous==2.1.2
Jinja2==3.1.2
MarkupSafe==2.1.1
Werkzeug==2.2.2
```


## Docker Image

1. In the DockerProject folder, create a file called **DockerFile** (this file has no extentions)
2. Edit the File:

```bash
# Dockerfile Reference = https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

# With the FROM keyword we can tell docker which image we are going to use.
# For a list of images: https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image
FROM python:alpine

# Copy our app
COPY . /app

# Set our app as the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install the requirements of our app
# Remember to generate this in our project: pip freeze > requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# We are using flask, so we need a port open
# Make sure you expose the same port as in your python flask script.
EXPOSE 5000

# Then run our app
CMD python ./main.py
```

3. Now that we have a DockerFile which is a crucial file for constructing a local docker image. <br />
We can now use Docker commands to **create** an image for our Flask App.
We can do this in the **Terminal**:

Open the **Terminal**: 
```bash title="Go to our project directory (if necessary)"
cd DockerProject
```

```bash title="building the image"
docker build -t myflaskimage .
```

4. Once you've created the image, you can find it:
   - Docker Desktop > images
   - Via Terminal command:
  ```bash title="show docker images"
  docker images --all
  ```

## Docker Container

Now that we have a Docker Image of our Flask App, let's build a container based on that image. <br />
There are a few ways of doing this:
- Docker Desktop <br />
  Under Images, click on **Run** button of the image named: myflaskimage <br />

- Terminal<br />
  --name *(name of container)* <br />
  -p **`<<container port>>` : `<<host port>>`** *(port exposure and forwarding)* <br />
  myflaskimage *(name of image)*

  ```bash
  docker run --name myflaskcontainer -p 5000:5000 myflaskimage
  ```
- Docker Compose *(to be seen in a later chapter)*
