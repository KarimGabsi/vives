# Docker Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. 
With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. 
Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## Multiple containers - Volume

Let's create a simple flask website that uses some IO functions. <br />
The purpose of this is the use of **volumes**, in this case we'll have two containers running where the data is stored in the same volume.

:::danger
Commit this code to the docker hub repository so that we have an online image based upon this script!
:::

```py title=mainVolume.py showLineNumbers
import os
from pathlib import Path
from flask import Flask

folder = "Data/logs/"
hits_path = folder + "hits.txt"
if not os.path.exists(folder):
    os.makedirs(folder)
    print("directories made")
Path(hits_path).touch(exist_ok=True)
print("file present: check.")

app = Flask(__name__)

def get_count():
    with open(hits_path, "r+") as file:
        val = file.readline()
        if val == '':
            return 0
        else:
            return int(val)

def new_user():
    try:
        hits = int(get_count())
        hits += 1
        with open(hits_path, "w") as file:
            file.write(str(hits))
        return hits
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)


@app.route('/')
def hello():
    users = new_user()
    return 'Hello World! I have been requested {} times.\n'.format(users)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=int(5000), debug=True)
```

Let's build two docker containers:
- one based upon the online image
- one that we will build when running the docker compose (see down below)

```text title=DockerfileVolume
# Dockerfile Reference = https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/

# With the FROM keyword we can tell docker which image we are going to use.
# For a list of images: https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=image
FROM python:alpine

# Copy our app
COPY . /app

# Set our app as the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install the requirements of our app
# Remember to generate this in our project: pip freeze > requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# We are using flask, so we need a port open
# Make sure you expose the same port as in your python flask script.
EXPOSE 5000

# Attach volume to the image
#VOLUME TestVolume

# Then run our app
CMD python ./mainVolume.py
```

## Docker Compose with PyCharm

- Create a volume via Docker Desktop and/or command line named: **TestVolume**
- Create an empty file called **docker-compose.yml**

```text title="docker-compose.yml"
version: "3.9"
services:
  onlinebuild:
    container_name: onlinewithvolume
    image: revelare/autobuildtest:latest
    pull_policy: always
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    volumes:
      - TestVolume:/app
  localbuild:
    container_name: localwithvolume
    build:
      dockerfile: DockerfileVolume
    image: localautobuild:latest
    ports:
      - 5001:5000
    volumes:
      - TestVolume:/app
volumes:
  TestVolume:
    external: false
    name: TestVolume
```

With PyCharm it is relativaly easy to execute a docker-compose file. <br />
All you need is to connect PyCharm with the docker daemon.
You will need to add this in the settings.

:::danger
Make sure you have PyCharm Professional for this!

Now you can simply execute the docker-compose by clicking on **services** in the docker-compose file.

## Docker Compose with CLI

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml
```

```text title="Extra commands info"
Define and run multi-container applications with Docker.

Usage:
  docker compose [-f <arg>...] [--profile <name>...] [options] [COMMAND] [ARGS...]
  docker compose -h|--help

Options:
  -f, --file FILE             Specify an alternate compose file
                              (default: docker-compose.yml)
  -p, --project-name NAME     Specify an alternate project name
                              (default: directory name)

  --verbose                   Show more output

## Results

We should see two containers now running from our docker compose:

![Docker Compose Result](/img/cloud-for-ai/docker_compose_result_1.png "Docker Compose Result 1")

Our **TestVolume** is in use by our two containers!

![Docker Compose Result](/img/cloud-for-ai/docker_compose_result_2.png "Docker Compose Result 2")

![Docker Compose Result](/img/cloud-for-ai/docker_compose_result_3.png "Docker Compose Result 3")

They both share the same data!
So our the file we are using for our view count is being **persistently used by two containers!**
