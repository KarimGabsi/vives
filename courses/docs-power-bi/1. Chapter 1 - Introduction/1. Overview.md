**Power BI** is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. 
Your data might be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. 
Power BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.

## Power BI Apps

Power BI consists of several elements that all work together, starting with these three basics:

- A Windows desktop application called Power BI Desktop.
- An online software as a service (SaaS) service called the Power BI service.
- Power BI Mobile apps for Windows, iOS, and Android devices.

## What is Business Intelligence (BI)?

Business intelligence (BI) uncovers insights for making strategic decisions. 
Business intelligence tools analyze historical and current data and present findings in intuitive visual formats.

## Business Intelligence Process

1. **Data collection:** <br />
Gathering data from various sources, such as transactional systems, spreadsheets, databases, and other data sources.


2. **Data integration:**  <br />
Integrating the collected data into a central repository, such as a data warehouse, for easier analysis.


3. **Data cleaning and preparation:** <br />
Removing duplicates, correcting errors, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis.


4. **Data analysis:** <br />
Analyzing the data to discover insights, trends, and patterns that can inform business decisions. 
This can include data visualization, reporting, dashboarding, and advanced analytics techniques such as data mining and predictive modeling.


5. **Data presentation:** <br />
Communicating the insights and results of the analysis to decision-makers in a clear and understandable format, such as reports, dashboards, and visualizations.


6. **Action and monitoring:** <br />
Based on the insights gained from the analysis, organizations can take action to improve performance and monitor the results of those actions over time.

## Benefits using Business Intelligence Tools

Because business intelligence tools speed up information analysis and performance evaluation, they’re valuable in helping companies reduce inefficiencies, flag potential problems, find new revenue streams, and identify areas of future growth.

Some of the specific benefits that businesses experience when using BI include:

- Increased efficiency of operational processes.
- Insight into customer behavior and shopping patterns.
- Accurate tracking of sales, marketing, and financial performance.
- Clear benchmarks based on historical and current data.
- Instant alerts about data anomalies and customer issues.
- Analyses that can be shared in real-time across departments.

In the past, business intelligence tools were primarily used by data analysts and IT users. 
Now, self-service BI platforms make business intelligence available to everyone from executives to operations teams.

## BI Impacts
