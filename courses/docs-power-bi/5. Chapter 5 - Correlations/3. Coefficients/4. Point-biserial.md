A point-biserial correlation is used to measure the strength and direction of the association that exists between one continuous variable and one dichotomous variable. It is a special case of the Pearson’s product-moment correlation, which is applied when you have two continuous variables, whereas in this case one of the variables is measured on a dichotomous scale.

For example, you could use a point-biserial correlation to determine whether there is an association between salaries, measured in US dollars, and gender (i.e., your continuous variable would be "salary" and your dichotomous variable would be "gender", which has two categories: "males" and "females"). Alternately, you could use a point-biserial correlation to determine whether there is an association between cholesterol concentration, measured in mmol/L, and smoking status (i.e., your continuous variable would be "cholesterol concentration", a marker of heart disease, and your dichotomous variable would be "smoking status", which has two categories: "smoker" and "non-smoker").

## Formula

$$
rpb = \frac{(M1 - M2)}{σ}
$$

where,

- $$M1$$ is the mean of the continuous variable for group 1 (e.g., individuals with a certain condition)
- $$M2$$ is the mean of the continuous variable for group 2 (e.g., individuals without the condition)
- $$σ$$ is the standard deviation of the continuous variable.

In this formula, $$M1$$ and $$M2$$ represent the means of the two groups, and σ represents the standard deviation of the continuous variable. 
The point-biserial correlation coefficient (rpb) is calculated as the difference between the means of the two groups divided by the standard deviation of the continuous variable.


## Example

Let's measure the relationship between a continuous variable (such as salary) and a binary variable (such as gender).

### Step 2: Calcuate Means

Mean salary for male employees: <br />

$$
M0 = \frac{ΣXi}{n0}
$$ 
where,

$$Xi$$ is the salary for each male employee, and $$n0$$ is the number of male employees.

$$
M0 = \frac{(60000 + 50000 + 55000 + 60000 + 45000 + 70000 + 55000 + 55000 + 50000)}{9} = 55555.56
$$

Mean salary for female employees: <br />
$$
M1 = \frac{ΣXi}{n1} 
$$
where,

$$Xi$$ is the salary for each female employee, and $$n1$$ is the number of female employees.

$$
M1 = \frac{(55000 + 65000 + 70000 + 60000 + 75000 + 80000 + 65000 + 55000 + 60000 + 70000)}{10} = 65500
$$

### Step 3: Standard Deviation

Standard deviation of the entire salary dataset:
$$
σ = \sqrt{\frac{Σ(Xi - μ)^2}{(n - 1)}} 
$$
where,

$$Xi$$ is the salary for each employee, $$μ$$ is the mean salary for the entire dataset, and $$n$$ is the total number of employees.

$$
σ = \sqrt{\frac{(55000-61000)^2 + (65000-61000)^2 + ... + (70000-61000)^2 + (70000-61000)^2}{(20 - 1)}}
$$
$$
σ = \sqrt{\frac{101383948.148}{19}} = 10068.819
$$


### Step 5: Putting it all together

Point-biserial correlation coefficient:
$$
rpb = \frac{(M1 - M2)}{σ}
$$

$$
rpb = \frac{(65500 - 55555.56)}{10068.819} = 0.104
$$

Using the point-biserial correlation algorithm,
we find that the point-biserial correlation coefficient between gender and salary in this company is `0.104`. <br />
This indicates a weak positive relationship between gender and salary, which means that female employees earn slightly higher salaries than male employees on average. <br />
However, the correlation is not statistically significant given the small sample size.

## Z-score

$$
Z = \frac{(X - μ)}{σ} 
$$
where,
$$X$$ is the salary for each employee, $$μ$$ is the mean salary for the entire dataset, and $$σ$$ is the standard deviation for the entire dataset.

**Employee ID 1:** <br />
$$
Z = \frac{(55000 - 61000)}{10068.819} = -0.594
$$
