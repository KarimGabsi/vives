Kendall-rank correlation, also known Kenall Tau, is a non-parametric method for measuring the association between two variables. <br />
Unlike Pearson correlation, which measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables, < br />
Kendall-rank correlation measures the rank-based relationship between two variables, regardless of the type of variables (continuous or ordinal).

## Formula
$$
T = \frac{(C-D)}{(C + D)}
$$

where,

$$
C = the\ number\ of\ concordant\ pairs
\\\
D = the\ number\ of\ discordant\ pairs
$$

## Concordant vs Disconcordant

In statistics, a concordant pair is a pair of observations, each on two variables, $$(X1,Y1)$$ and $$(X2,Y2)$$, having the property that

$$
sgn(X2-X1) = sgn(Y2-Y1)
$$

where "sgn" refers to whether a number is positive, zero, or negative (its sign). <br />
Specifically, the signum function, often represented as sgn, is defined as:

$$
sgn\ x = \begin{cases}
-1, &\text{x < 0 }\\
0, &\text{x = 0 }\\
1, &\text{x > 0 } 
\end{cases}
$$

That is, in a concordant pair, both elements of one pair are either greater than, equal to, or less than the corresponding elements of the other pair.<br />

In contrast, a discordant pair is a pair of two-variable observations such that

$$
sgn(X2-X1) = -sgn(Y2-Y1)
$$

That is, if one pair contains a higher value of X then the other pair contains a higher value of Y.
## Example

Suppose two basketball coaches rank 12 of their players from worst to best. <br />
The following table shows the rankings that each coach assigned to the players:

Because we are working with two columns of ranked data, it’s appropriate to use Kendall’s Tau to calculate the correlation between the two coaches’ rankings

### Step 1: Concordant pairs

Look only at the ranks for **Coach #2**. <br />
Starting with the first player, count how many ranks below him are larger. <br />
For example, there are 11 numbers below “1” that are larger, so we’ll write 11.

Once we reach a player whose rank is less than the player before him, we simply assign it the same value as the player before him. 
For example, Elliot has a rank of “4” which is less than the previous player’s rank of “5” so we simply assign him the same value as the player before him

            <td>2</td>
            <td>10</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>3</td>
            <td>3</td>

            <td>7</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Greg</td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Hank</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>4</td>

        <tr>
            <td>Isaiah</td>
            <td>9</td>

            <td>Kurt</td>
            <td>11</td>

            <td>1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Luke</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Step 2: Disconcordant pairs

Again, look only at the ranks for **Coach #2**. <br />
For each player, count how many ranks below him are smaller. <br />
For example, Coach #2 assigned AJ a rank of “1” and there are no players below him with a smaller rank. <br />
Thus, we assign him a value of 0.

Repeat this process for each player.

### Step 3: Calculate sum

$$
Σ(C) = 11 + 10 + 9 + ... + 2 + 2 + 1 = 63
$$

$$
Σ(D) = 0 + 0 + 0 + ... + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3
$$

Apply the formula:

$$
T = \frac{(C-D)}{(C+D)}
\\\
\\\
T =\frac{(63-3)}{(63+3)}
\\\
\\\
T =\frac{60}{66}
\\\
\\\
T = 0.909.
$$


When you have more than n= 10 pairs, Kendall’s Tau generally follows a normal distribution. You can use the following formula to calculate a z-score for Kendall’s Tau:

$$
z = \frac{3T*\sqrt{n(n-1)}}{\sqrt{2(2n+5)}}
$$

where,

$$
T = Kendall’s\ Tau
\\\
n = number\ of\ pairs
$$

### Basketball P Score:

$$
z = \frac{3(.909)*\sqrt{12(12-1)}}{\sqrt{2(2*12+5)}} = 4.11
$$

### Basketball Z Score:

Using the [Z Score to P Value Calculator](https://www.statology.org/z-score-to-p-value-calculator/), we see that the p-value for this z-score is 0.00004, which is statistically significant at alpha level 0.05. <br />
**Thus, there is a statistically significant correlation between the ranks that the two coaches assigned to the players.**
