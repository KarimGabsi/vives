## What is a correlation?

Correlation describes the relationship between variables. 
It can be described as either strong or weak, and as either positive or negative.

## What is causation?

The relationship between cause and effect.


:::danger
It is very important to know that correlation does **not necessarily** mean causation

## Types

In statistics, the general consensus is that there are four types of correlations:

1. Positive Linear Correlation
2. Negative Linear Correlation
3. Non-linear Correlation
4. No Correlation

### Positive Linear 
We can say that tere is a positive linear correlation when the variable on the x-axis increases as the variable on the y-axis increases.

### Negative Linear 

We can say that there is a negative linear correlation when one variable increases as the other variable decreases.

### Non-linear Linear 

We can say that there is a non-linear correlation when there is a relationship between variables whilst the relationship is not linear or bent.

### No Correlation

When the points are too scattered it shows no pattern and thus no relationship could be established.

## Coefficient

"However, it is not always as easy to tell just by looking at the scatter graph, instead we quantify it using a numeric value known as **the correlation coefficient**."

There are several correlation coefficients that we can use, each has their own uses. 
We're exploring four of them:

1. Pearson correlation
2. Kendall-rank correlation
3. Spearman correlation
4. Point-biserial correlation

### Pearson

This method measures the linear relationship between two continuous variables. <br />
It is based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables on a scale of -1 to 1,<br />
where <br />
-1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, <br />
1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship, <br />
and 0 indicates no linear relationship.

#### Formula

The Pearson correlation coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:
$$
r = \frac{n(∑xy) - (∑x)(∑y)}{\sqrt{[n∑x^2 - (∑x)^2][n∑y^2 - (∑y)^2)]}}
$$

where:

$$
n = number\ of\ data\ points
\\\
x = the\ first\ variable
\\\
y = the\ second\ variable
\\\
∑xy = the\ sum\ of\ the\ product\ of\ x\ and\ y\ values
\\\
∑x = the\ sum\ of\ x\ values
\\\
∑y = the\ sum\ of\ y\ values
\\\
∑x^2 = the\ sum\ of\ the\ square\ of\ x\ values
\\\
∑y^2 = the\ sum\ of\ the\ square\ of\ y\ values
$$

### Kendall-rank

This method measures the rank-based relationship between two variables, regardless of the type of variables (continuous or ordinal). 
It is based on the Kendall tau coefficient and is commonly used for ordinal or interval-scaled data. 
It measures the relationship between two variables by counting the number of concordant and discordant pairs of values.

### Spearman

This method measures the rank-based relationship between two variables, regardless of the type of variables (continuous or ordinal). 
It is based on the Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient and is commonly used for ordinal or interval-scaled data.
It measures the relationship between two variables by converting the data into ranks and then calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.

#### Example

### Point-biserial

This method measures the relationship between a continuous variable and a dichotomous variable. 
It is based on the Point-biserial correlation coefficient and is used to measure the relationship between a continuous variable and a binary variable, such as pass/fail or male/female.
